        "Description": "Job description\n\nAbout this role\n\nRole Brief\nWhen BlackRock was started in 1988, its founders envisioned a company that combined the best of financial services with cutting edge technology. They imagined a business that would provide financial services to clients as well as technology services to other financial firms. The result of their vision is Aladdin, our industry leading, end-to-end investment management platform. With assets valued over USD $7 trillion managed on Aladdin, our technology empowers millions of investors to save for retirement, pay for college, buy a home and improve their financial wellbeing.\n\nData is at the heart of Aladdin and increasingly the ability to consume, store, analyze and gain insight from data has become a key component of our competitive advantage. The Aladdin Data team is responsible for the data ecosystem within BlackRock. Our goal is to build and maintain a leading-edge data platform that provides highly available, consistent data of the highest quality for all users of the platform, notably investors, operations teams and data scientists. We focus on evolving our platform to deliver exponential scale to the firm, powering the future growth of Aladdin.\n\nStudio Engineers at BlackRock get to experience working at one of the most recognized financial companies in the world while being part of a software development team responsible for next generation technologies and solutions. Our engineers design and build large scale data storage, computation and distribution systems. They partner with data and analytics experts to deliver high quality analytical and derived data to our consumers.\n\nWe are looking for Full Stack engineers who like to innovate and seek complex problems.

Design is an iterative process, whether for UX, services or infrastructure. Our goal is to drive up user engagement and adoption of the platform while constantly working towards modernizing and improving platform performance and scalability.\n\nDeployment and maintenance require close interaction with various teams. This requires maintaining a positive and collaborative working relationship with teams within Studio as well as with wider Aladdin developer community. Production support for applications is usually required for issues that cannot be resolved by operations team. Creative and inventive problem-solving skills for reduced turnaround times are highly valued.\n\nManaging a highly functional team for both development and operations continuity is integral to the role. Adhering to BlackRock's UX and design standards is expected and contributing towards upkeep of those standards is encouraged.\n\nAnd Ideal candidate would have\n\nBA/BS in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience\n\nAt least 15+ years’ experience delivering large scale enterprise solutions.\n\nMust have experience architecting and building scalable distributed applications\n\nExperience in Java, React, Angular, Python, SQL, Linux is a must\n\nExperience with Event Driven Architecture, Micro Services and Cloud technologies\n\nExperience / Familiarity with object-oriented design patterns\n\nExperience with dev ops tools like Git, Maven, Jenkins, Gitlab CI, Azure DevOps\n\nExperience with Agile development concepts and related tools\n\nAbility to trouble shoot and fix performance issues across the codebase and database queries\n\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills\n\nPassion for learning and implementing new technologies\n\nAbility to operate under fast-paced environment\n\nSkills that would be a plus\n\nPerl\n\nC++\n\nExperience supporting large scale, complex analytics requirements\n\nOur benefits\n\nTo help you stay energized, engaged and inspired, we offer a wide range of benefits including a strong retirement plan, tuition reimbursement, comprehensive healthcare, support for working parents and Flexible Time Off (FTO) so you can relax, recharge and be there for the people you care about.\n\nOur hybrid work model\n\nBlackRock’s hybrid work model is designed to enable a culture of collaboration and apprenticeship that enriches the experience of our employees, while supporting flexibility for all. Employees are currently required to work at least 4 days in the office per week, with the flexibility to work from home 1 day a week.

We remain focused on increasing the impactful moments that arise when we work together in person – aligned with our commitment to performance and innovation. As a new joiner, you can count on this hybrid model to accelerate your learning and onboarding experience here at BlackRock.\n\nAbout BlackRock\n\nAt BlackRock, we are all connected by one mission: to help more and more people experience financial well-being. Our clients, and the people they serve, are saving for retirement, paying for their children’s educations, buying homes and starting businesses.
